The usual parallel design of merge sort recursively executes the sorting of the array halves in parallel, followed by a sequential merge phase. The maximum speedup that can be achieved in this way (given enough processors) can be shown to be log(n)/2 where n is the size of the array and log is the binary logarithm. In order to improve on this rather disappointing result one must also tackle the merge phase in parallel and my solution (using IntelliJ and Java) can be found here.
